# NHB_Globalization_Revisit

This repo is for plotting the inequality of sampling in psychological research. We compared three countries' data from Ruggeri et al (2022, NHB) with the census data of these three countries to show the lack of representativeness.

This project is a collaboration with Sakshi Ghai and Patrick Forscher.
